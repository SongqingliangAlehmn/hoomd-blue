R""" Neighbor list acceleration structures.

Neighbor lists accelerate pair force calculation by maintaining a list of particles within a cutoff radius.
Multiple pair forces can utilize the same neighbor list. Neighbors are included using a pairwise cutoff
:math:`r_\mathrm{cut}(i,j)` that is the maximum of all :math:`r_\mathrm{cut}(i,j)` set for the pair forces attached
to the list.

Multiple neighbor lists can be created to accelerate simulations where there is significant disparity in
:math:`r_\mathrm{cut}(i,j)` between pair potentials. If one pair force has a cutoff radius much smaller than
another pair force, the pair force calculation for the short cutoff will be slowed down considerably because many
particles in the neighbor list will have to be read and skipped because they lie outside the shorter cutoff.

The simplest way to build a neighbor list is :math:`O(N^2)`: each particle loops over all other particles and only
includes those within the neighbor list cutoff. This algorithm is no longer implemented in HOOMD-blue because it is
slow and inefficient. Instead, three accelerated algorithms based on cell lists and bounding volume hierarchy trees
are implemented. The cell list implementation is usually fastest when the cutoff radius is similar between all pair forces
(smaller than 2:1 ratio). The stencil implementation is a different variant of the cell list, and its main use is when a
cell list would be faster than a tree but memory demands are too big. The tree implementation is faster when there is
large size disparity, but its performance has been improved to be only slightly slower than the cell list for many use
cases. Because the performance of these algorithms depends on your system and hardware, you should carefully test which
option is fastest for your simulation.

Particles can be excluded from the neighbor list based on certain criteria. Setting :math:`r_\mathrm{cut}(i,j) \le 0`
will exclude this cross interaction from the neighbor list on build time. Particles can also be excluded by topology
or for belonging to the same rigid body (see :py:meth:`nlist.reset_exclusions()`). To support molecular structures,
the body flag can also be used to exclude particles that are not part of a rigid structure. All particles with
positive values of the body flag are considered part of a rigid body (see :py:class:`hoomd.md.constrain.rigid`),
while the default value of -1 indicates that a particle is free. Any other negative value of the body flag indicates
that the particles are part of a floppy body; such particles are integrated
separately, but are automatically excluded from the neighbor list as well.

Examples::

    nl_c = nlist.cell(check_period=1)
    nl_t = nlist.tree(r_buff = 0.8)
    lj1 = pair.lj(r_cut = 3.0, nlist=nl_c)
    lj2 = pair.lj(r_cut = 10.0, nlist=nl_t)

    :py:class:`stencil` creates a cell list based neighbor list object to which pair potentials can be attached for computing

    spatially sorted into cells based on the largest pairwise cutoff radius attached to this instance of the neighbor
    list.

    `M.P. Howard et al. 2016 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2016.02.003>`_ describes this neighbor list implementation
    in HOOMD-blue. Cite it if you utilize this neighbor list style in your work.

    This neighbor-list style differs from :py:class:`cell` based on how the adjacent cells are searched for particles. The cell
    list *cell_width* is set by default using the shortest active cutoff radius in the system. One *stencil* is computed
    per particle type based on the largest cutoff radius that type participates in, which defines the bins that the
    particle must search in. Distances to the bins in the stencil are precomputed so that certain particles can be
    quickly excluded from the neighbor list, leading to improved performance compared to :py:class:`cell` when there is size
    disparity in the cutoff radius. The memory demands of :py:class:`stencil` can also be lower than :py:class:`cell` if your
    system is large and has many small cells in it; however, :py:class:`tree` is usually a better choice for these systems.

    The performance of the stencil depends strongly on the choice of *cell_width*. The best performance is obtained
    when the cutoff radii are multiples of the *cell_width*, and when the *cell_width* covers the simulation box with
    a roughly integer number of cells. The *cell_width* can be set manually, or be automatically scanning through a range
    of possible bin widths using :py:meth:`tune_cell_width()`.

    Examples::

        nl_s = nlist.stencil(check_period = 1)
        nl_s.set_params(r_buff=0.5)
        nl_s.reset_exclusions([]);
        nl_s.tune()
        nl_s.tune_cell_width(min_width=1.5, max_width=3.0)

    Note:
        *d_max* should only be set when slj diameter shifting is required by a pair potential. Currently, slj
        is the only pair potential requiring this shifting, and setting *d_max* for other potentials may lead to
        significantly degraded performance or incorrect results.

    :py:class:`tree` creates a neighbor list using bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) tree traversal. Pair potentials are attached
    for computing non-bonded pairwise interactions. A BVH tree of axis-aligned bounding boxes is constructed per particle
    type, and each particle queries each tree to determine its neighbors. This method of searching leads to significantly
    improved performance compared to cell lists in systems with moderate size asymmetry, but has slightly poorer performance
    (10% slower) for monodisperse systems. :py:class:`tree` can also be slower than :py:class:`cell` if there are multiple
    types in the system, but the cutoffs between types are identical. (This is because one BVH is created per type.)
    The user should carefully benchmark neighbor list build times to select the appropriate neighbor list construction type.
